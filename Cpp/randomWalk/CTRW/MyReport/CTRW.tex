\section{Introduction}
Transport is an ubuquitous non-equilibrium phenomena that occurs in different scenarios. Diffusion is one type of transport that is signalized by a mean square displacement
%
\begin{equation}
 \langle \Delta r^2 \rangle \sim t^{\alpha}
\end{equation}
%
where, $\alpha = 1$ for normal diffusion, $\alpha < 1$ for subdiffusive and $1 < \alpha <2 $ for a superdiffusive and ballistic for $\alpha = 2$.
%
Therefore a general description to get the different types of diffusion is by using a Continuous time random walk.
